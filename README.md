The dataset consists of 2 folders: 'train' and 'test'. The folder 'train' is a labelled dataset and consists of 2 sub-folders: 'Raveling' and 'Non_raveling'. The sub-folder 'Raveling' consists of a total of 350 images containing ravening distress, while the 'Non_raveling' sub-folder contains 350 images with no raveling distress. All images are of the ‘.jpg’ format.
The ‘test’ folder consists of the test dataset images. There are a total of 700 images in this folder (all ‘.jpg’ files). These images are unlabelled i.e., the labels are not provided, whether they contain ravening distress or not. The objective of this challenge is to predict the class of each of these test images. The class can be either ‘Raveling’ or ‘Non_raveling’. The filenames of these test images are given as 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, …, 300.jpg.
A sample output submission file is also provided.
